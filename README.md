# Hospital-Management-System

"Empowering Healthcare through Technology"

This project is a Hospital Management System developed using Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of a hospital, from patient records to staff management and resource allocation.

Features:
Seamless Communication: Utilizes JDBC to establish efficient communication between the application and PostgreSQL database, ensuring smooth data transactions and management within the hospital system.
Patient Management: Allows for the efficient management of patient records, including registration, appointment scheduling, medical history, and billing.
Staff Management: Facilitates the management of hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel, with features for scheduling shifts, managing payroll, and tracking attendance.
Resource Allocation: Optimizes resource allocation within the hospital, including equipment, rooms, and medical supplies, to ensure efficient operation and patient care.

Technologies Used:
Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application, providing flexibility, scalability, and platform independence.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Enables seamless interaction between the application and the PostgreSQL database, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system used to store and manage the hospital's data securely.
